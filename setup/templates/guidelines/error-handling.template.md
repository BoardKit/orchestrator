## Logging Standards

### Log Levels

- **ERROR** - System failures, exceptions, critical issues
- **WARN** - Unexpected behavior, degraded functionality
- **INFO** - Important system events, state changes
- **DEBUG** - Detailed diagnostic information

### What to Log

{{LOGGING_PATTERNS}}

**General Principles:**
- Log all errors with full context
- Include request IDs for tracing
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use structured logging (JSON) when possible
- Include stack traces for unexpected errors

## Error Responses

## Common Error Scenarios

{{COMMON_ERROR_SCENARIOS}}

---

## Error Recovery

{{ERROR_RECOVERY_PATTERNS}}

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

{{MONITORING_SECTION}}

**Key Metrics:**
- Error rates by endpoint/function
- Error types and frequency
- Recovery success rates
- User-impacting errors

---

## Best Practices

{{ERROR_HANDLING_BEST_PRACTICES}}

**Universal Best Practices:**
- ✅ Always handle errors, never silently fail
- ✅ Provide meaningful error messages
- ✅ Log errors with full context
- ✅ Return appropriate error codes/types
- ✅ Clean up resources in finally/defer blocks
- ✅ Test error paths thoroughly
- ❌ Don't expose internal details to users
- ❌ Don't catch errors without handling them
- ❌ Don't log the same error multiple times

## Notes for AI Agents

When implementing error handling:
1. Check which tech stack you're working in
2. Follow patterns defined in this document
3. Ensure errors are logged appropriately
4. Return user-friendly error messages
5. Test both success and error paths
