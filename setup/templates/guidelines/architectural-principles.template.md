## Overview

This document defines the architectural principles and patterns for the **{{ORG_NAME}}** system.

**System Composition:**
{{REPO_COUNT}} repositories working together to deliver the complete solution.

## Separation of Concerns

### What Belongs Where

{{SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS_SECTION}}

**General Principles:**
1. **Keep related code together** - Don't split tightly coupled code across repos
2. **Minimize cross-repo dependencies** - Each repo should be as independent as possible
3. **Share via APIs/packages** - Inter-repo communication through well-defined interfaces
{{CROSS_REPO_PRINCIPLE}}4. **Document boundaries** - Be explicit about what belongs where{{/CROSS_REPO_PRINCIPLE}}

## Development Workflow

### Single-Repo Changes

For changes contained within one repository:
1. Work in that repository
2. Follow its specific patterns and conventions
3. Test thoroughly within the repo
4. Deploy independently (if applicable)

### Multi-Repo Changes

{{MULTI_REPO_WORKFLOW}}

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

{{ANTI_PATTERNS_SECTION}}

**Generic Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Duplicating logic across repos
- ❌ Tight coupling between repos
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling
- ❌ Missing integration tests
- ❌ Undocumented dependencies

- **Skills:** Each repo has a corresponding skill in `shared/skills/`
- **Error Handling:** See `error-handling.md` for patterns
- **Testing:** See `testing-standards.md` for strategies

## Notes for AI Agents

When working across the {{ORG_NAME}} system:
1. Always check which repo you're in
2. Verify changes belong in the current repo
3. Consider impact on other repos
4. Reference this document when unsure
5. Follow repo-specific patterns from skills
